## 
Updated to include Randall Munroe as author of XKCD and copyright holder.

I updated the description and the DESCRIPTION to include the url to the website I'm referring to and standardized 'XKCD'. I've also fixed the empty url in the README.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
