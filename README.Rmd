# XKCDdata

XKCDdata is a little package to get data from individual [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) comics.

## Installation
 
```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RobertMyles/XKCDdata")
```

## Example:  

Let's get this comic (it's number 1421):  

![https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/future_self.png](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/future_self.png) 


```{r}
library(XKCDdata)

get_comic(comic = 1421)

```


Or you can get a list of comics pretty easily using purrr, `apply()` or for loops. With purrr, it would be something like: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# list of comics:
cm <- c(1421, 641, 87, 92)
purrr::map_df(cm, get_comic)
```

Then you could plot it XKCD-style with the [xkcd](http://xkcd.r-forge.r-project.org/) package if you wanted.
